## Language & Framework
Python 

## Development Guildlines
**Modularity**
Following the principle "loose coupling and high cohesion", each module should be standalone.

**Minimalism**
Each module should be kept short, simple, and concise. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading.

**Easy extensibility** 
New modules (as new classes and functions) are should be simply add, and existing modules should be extended easily.
